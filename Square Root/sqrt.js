// Following Babylonian Method for Square Root

/*

This method can be derived from (but predates) Newtonâ€“Raphson method.


	1 Start with an arbitrary positive start value x (the closer to the 
   	  root, the better).
	2 Initialize y = 1.
	3. Do following until desired approximation is achieved.
  		a) Get the next approximation for root using average of x and y
  		b) Set y = n/x
